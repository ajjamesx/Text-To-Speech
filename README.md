# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech Reader (Python)

This is a simple Python application that reads aloud the contents of a `.txt` file using your system's built-in text-to-speech engine. It leverages the `pyttsx3` library for offline speech synthesis, making it ideal for accessibility, productivity, or learning use cases.

## 📂 How It Works

1. The user adds text to a file called `input.txt`.
2. The program reads that file.
3. It converts the text into speech and speaks it out loud.
